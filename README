Python scripts (and a udev rule) to keep track of new photos on a Canon memory card, and copy them automatically when that card is mounted.

A hierarchical date directory structure is created on the target filesystem (e.g. /target/2015/08/10/123_1008.jpg) 

--- Installation ---

Copy 81-sdcard-sync.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/
Copy the Python files to /usr/bin/
